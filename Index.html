      Lincoln won re-election in 1864, as Union peace, the President was flexible and generous, encouraging military triumphs heralded an end to the war. In his planning forSoutherners to lay down their arms and join speedily in reunion.
      The spirit that guided him was clearly that of his Second Inaugural Address, now inscribed on one wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D. C.: “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds…. ”
      On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated at Ford’s Theatre in Washington by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, who somehow thought he was helping the South. The opposite was the result, for with Lincoln’s death, the possibility of peace with magnanimity died.

        <strong>1830</strong> - At age 21 Lincoln helps his family move to Illinois by driving their team of oxen on the 200-mile (320-kilometer) trek. In the next years he works splitting rails (in other words, cutting up logs to make fences) and as a postmaster and member of a boat crew.
      </li>

        <strong>1832–34</strong> - Lincoln runs for his first political office, in the Illinois state legislature, and loses. He wins election in his second attempt, in 1834, and then wins reelection three times thereafter.

During a murder trial a witness says that he could see Lincoln’s client commit the crime in the bright moonlight.
